# RFC: Tagging system

## Overview

Vovere supports a flexible tagging system that allows you to organize and categorize your items using hashtags. Tags are automatically extracted from the content of items when they're saved, making it easy to maintain consistent organization across your repository.

## How Tags Work

### Tag Format

Tags in Vovere follow these rules:

1. Tags must start with a `#` symbol
2. Tags cannot contain spaces or blank characters
3. Tags can contain a wide range of characters including:
   - Letters and numbers
   - Dots (`.`) and colons (`:`) inside the tag (not at the end)
   - Special characters like hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), and plus signs (`+`)
4. Tags cannot end with punctuation or stop characters

### Valid Tag Examples

```
#project
#work.important
#priority:high
#tag-with-hyphens
#tag_with_underscores
#tag+plus+signs
#project:subtask:detail
```

### Invalid Tag Examples

```
# space-after-hash
#tag with spaces
#tag.
#tag:
#tag!
```

## Using Tags

### Adding Tags to Items

To add tags to an item, simply include hashtags in the content:

```
# My Task

This is a task related to #project:website and has #priority:high.
```

When this content is saved, the tags `project:website` and `priority:high` will be automatically extracted and associated with the item.

### Removing Tags

To remove a tag from an item, simply remove the hashtag from the content and save the item. The tag association will be automatically updated.

### Searching by Tags

You can search for items with specific tags using the tag search functionality. This allows you to:

1. Find all items with a specific tag
2. Find items that have multiple specific tags
3. Browse all available tags in your repository

## Tag Organization

Tags are stored in the `.meta/tags` directory of your repository, with each tag having its own JSON file containing the list of item IDs associated with that tag.

## Advanced Tag Features

1. **Multiple Tag Filtering**: Find items that have all of a specified set of tags
2. **Tag Statistics**: View usage statistics for your tags to understand how they're distributed across your items
3. **Tag Search**: Search for tags matching a specific prefix

## Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent**: Use a consistent tagging scheme (e.g., `category:subcategory`) to make organization easier
2. **Use Hierarchy**: Leverage colons to create tag hierarchies (e.g., `project:website:frontend`)
3. **Avoid Tag Sprawl**: Try to reuse existing tags rather than creating new variations
4. **Tag Meaningfully**: Choose tags that help you find and organize your content effectively
